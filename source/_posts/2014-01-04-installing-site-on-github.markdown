Installing the site on github was easy, using [the instructions from the octopress site](http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/).

The site is now on the (earlab organization page)[http://earlab.github.io/].

I still need to check what `rake deploy` does now.  I.e.:

- Do I need to run `rake generate` as before?
- Do I need to commit manually before running `rake deploy`?
